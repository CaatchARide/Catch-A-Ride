# Catch-A-Ride
A long distance carpooling webApp
For this project, since we were unable to meet in person, we decided to collaborate by using applications such as Zoom, a video-conferencing application, for team scrum meetings and to have the front-end and back-end teams communicate when we had our collective group meetings. Along with Zoom, we used Slack, which is another team communication platform, to communicate if we had smaller topics to discuss or minor questions other members of our group could possibly solve. We used GitHub as well to have our codes in one location and easily accessible for when we needed to update the project with individual changes being made by each member. For this project we had assigned different jobs to each other and as time went on members were able to make changes to other members' code.
